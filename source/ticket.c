/*
    standard crypto (ticketless).
    easy access functions for
        ticket dumping.
        ticket listing.
        ticket deleting.
    have a struct which will contain name belonging to each ticket and rights_id (for deleting / dumping).
    have menu_tickets.c call all functions from here.
        menu should only be a browser for tickets, functions should be inside this file.
    probably some other stuff which ive forgotten...
